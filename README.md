## IRC protocol
- The IRC protocol uses a system of servers and clients to allow users to connect to discussion channels in real time.
- IRC clients must connect to an IRC server using a nickname, username and password, then they can join public or private chat channels.
- IRC commands are used to perform actions, such as joining a channel, leaving a channel, sending a private message, etc.
- IRC channel operators are users who have special privileges on a channel, such as kicking other users or changing channel settings.
